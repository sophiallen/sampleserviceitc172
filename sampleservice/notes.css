    1. create data entities 
    2. add new wcf service
    3. write contracts into the interface
        3.5. If you want to create a class, create it in the Interface as a data contract, below where you created the service contract. 
            Make sure that the new class you've created is reflected in the service contracts and the services you implement that make use of it. 
    4. go to the service, mouse over the I[servicename] and select "implement interface" 
        5. in the service, create a new db entities object (ex: Community_AssistEntities db = new Community_AssistEntities();)
        6. In the service methods, create a variable and store results of linq query to it. make sure you're selecting a new {r.something}
        7. Create a new list to store results, loop through the linq results and store to the list you created. 
        8. Return the list of strings (or objects, if you created your own class class) created.
